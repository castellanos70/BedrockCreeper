# BedrockCreeper
Minecraft Datapack bringing Creativity, Intrest, Challange, Fun and Balance

## Dev Notes:
### Creating Resource Pack, BedrockCreeper_RP_x.y.z.zip
1. The TOP LEVEL of the `.zip` must have `assets` folder, `pack.mcmeta`, `pack.png`, and `Selected Packs.txt` files.
2. Into a temporary working folder, tmp, which is ignored by git, copy the contents of `resource_pack\BedrockCreeper_vanilla-tweaks`. Next, merge into the blocks and textures directories `resource_pack\BedrockCreeper_blocks` and `resource_pack\BedrockCreeper_textures`.
