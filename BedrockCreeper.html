    <dd>- Version 1.0.1<br>
        <p>Zombies &amp; Husk: loot and hardness scales with level of the nearest player No changes from vanilla
            if player level is &lt; 15 (level &lt;17 for Husks). Changes max out when player is level 40 (level 45 for Husks).</p>

        <p>Drowned: If killed by player less than level 15, drowned have the vanilla chance of dropping 1 copper ingot.
            If killer is lvl 15 to 24, drowned has 50% chance to drop 1 copper ingot. If player is level 25 to 34,
            drowned has a 33% chance to drop 1 copper and 33% of dropping 2 copper. When a drowned spawns, if
            nearest player is less then level 15, drowned health and items are vanilla. If nearest player is
            higher then level 15 when the drowned is spawned, then the drowned gets additional health, higher chance
            of having a trident and higher chance of powerfully enchanted trident. These effects increase with player
            level but max out at player level 40.</p>

        <p>Pigln: loot and hardness increase starting at player level 15 and max out at lvl 45.</p>

        <p>Pillagers: loot and hardness increase starting at player level 5 and max out at lvl 25.</p>

        <p>Wandering Trader: In addition to vanilla trades, the wandering trader has a chance of having any of
            many rare blocks including guilded blackstone, ancient debris,  villager spawn eggs and bedrock.</p>

        <p>Awesome chests: The random loot generated in some chests has been greatly increased over vanilla.
            These include chests in abandoned mineshafts, buried treasure, ruined nether portals,
            shipwrecks, simple dungeons and underwater ruins. Compaired to vanilla chests, these chests are many
            many times better. This is done in an attempt to balance the vanilla OP ability to make automated and
            semi-automated farms which, in vanilla, make most chests not worth bothering to open. These enhancements
            are designed to encurrage exploration of the world.</p>
